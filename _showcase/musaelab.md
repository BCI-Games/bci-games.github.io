This collaborative dungeon grab-and-dash game places players against a fearsome dragon as they try to navigate their carts around the randomly generated map to collect all of the gems! Each player can gain unique power-ups on the map from the gems, but need to avoid the dragon or else it might be game over for everyone. Movement is controlled directly through the BCI visual schemes of P300 and SSVEP.
