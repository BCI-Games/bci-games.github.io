Have you ever wanted to challenge your friends to kerling on a spaceship? Here, teams of 2 compete in the classic sport of curling - on an alien spaceship! One team member uses a single button BCI action to control the trajectory of the stone, with the other member using repetitive BCI actions to brush the stone into place!
