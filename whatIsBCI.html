            <h4>What is a Brain-Computer Interface, or BCI, really?</h4>
            <p>
                Broadly, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a new and growing technology that allow people to interact with their environment using just the patterns in their brain.
                By reading simple electric changes that happen on the surface of the brain, BCIs can detect high level changes in attention, focus, or even imagined actions.
                This lets people interact with their world in new and exciting ways, and bypassing traditional input methods like a keyboard or mouse, which may be limiting for persons with complex motor differences.
                By directly processing these brain signals and intents, BCIs can open up incredible new opportunities for everyone to be able to game - irrespective of potential physical limitations. 
            </p>
            <h4>How do BCIs work then?</h4>
            <p>
                There are many different types of BCI systems, with the most common using a series of sensors placed on the scalp to read the electric patterns of the brain, called electroencephalography or "EEG".
                We can then elicit well known patterns from the brain and pair their responses to desired actions in game - such as moving a character or selecting an item.
                To elicit these patterns, we can use outside driving stimuli, like flashing lights or sounds or changes in the game environment, and detect changes to a person's attention or focus.
                Alternatively, we can use internal stimuli, like imagining moving a limb or focusing on a specific thought, to elicit another set of patterns, and again examine specific readings from the EEG.
                Don't worry though - what we can detect is very broad and high level, so we can't read your thoughts or inner feelings, just the general changes in your brain activity!
                So we might know you're imaginging a movement of some kind, but couldn't tell if you were picturing throwing a baseball or petting a dog. (Or if you even have a dog).

        </div>

        <div class ="text">
            <h4>I don't own a BCI - Can I still participate?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes! We have a number of BCI headsets available at our participating in-person sites and will work with everyone throughout the event to test and debug your game with real BCI systems.
                Additionally, we look to make sure the games work no matter what, so we will ask you to develop the game to be playable with keyboard and mouse for debugging purposes, but will work with you to verify it works with BCI!
                Also, if you are joining a participating in-person space we will have opportunities to try out the headsets for yourself.
                Prizes in the past have included new BCI headsets as well, so you can keep creating after the event!
            </p>
            <h4>I don't know anything about BCI - is that Ok?</h4>
            <p>
                Of course! 
                This event is about education as well as fun. We have experts in BCI systems (design and development) as well as lived-experience experts who use BCI systems regularly who are excited to teach you more about how the systems work.
                To make things easier for you as well, we offer a number of free, open source tools in partnership with BCI4Kids to help you "add in" BCI functionality as seamlessly as possible. (Thanks Brian! You rock!) <br>

            </p>
            <h4>Can BCIs read my mind?</h4>
            <p>
                Not at all! 
                Don't worry, we have no way of reading any specific details or thoughts from your brain activity. 
                We are only looking for certain patterns that occur in response to different external (i.e., looking at a flashing light) or internal (i.e., imagining movement) events. 
                Think of it the same way that a mood ring can 'read emotion'- it is just inferring from some physiological response (cold/hot hands), but has no actual insight into the complex infrastructure of emotion.
            </p>
            <h4>Aren't BCI systems science fiction or something you have to implant?</h4>
            <p>
                Nope! BCI research has been going for over two decades with pretty significant strides happening in the last 5 years.
                While lots of BCI systems featured in the news are implantable, there are many systems (like those we often work with) which are called "non-invasive" as they read electric signals from the scalp from a wearable headset.
                And don't worry - while some billionares and corporations are making media waves with BCI, they are pretty new to the game. Such groups are helping raise the general awareness that these technologies exist - and hopefully events like this show what this technology could help do!
