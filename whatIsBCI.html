            <h4>What is a Brain-Computer Interface, or BCI, really?</h4>
            <p>
                Broadly, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a new and growing technology that allow people to interact with their environment using just the patterns in their brain.
                By reading simple electric changes that happen on the surface of the brain, BCIs can detect high level changes in attention, focus, or even imagined actions.
                This lets people interact with their world in new and exciting ways, and bypassing traditional input methods like a keyboard or mouse, which may be limiting for persons with complex motor differences.
                By directly processing these brain signals and intents, BCIs can open up incredible new opportunities for everyone to be able to game - irrespective of potential physical limitations. 
            </p>
            <h4>How do BCIs work then?</h4>
            <p>
                There are many different types of BCI systems, with the most common using a series of sensors placed on the scalp to read the electric patterns of the brain, called electroencephalography or "EEG".
                We can then elicit well known patterns from the brain and pair their responses to desired actions in game - such as moving a character or selecting an item.
                To elicit these patterns, we can use outside driving stimuli, like flashing lights or sounds or changes in the game environment, and detect changes to a person's attention or focus.
                Alternatively, we can use internal stimuli, like imagining moving a limb or focusing on a specific thought, to elicit another set of patterns, and again examine specific readings from the EEG.
                Don't worry though - what we can detect is very broad and high level, so we can't read your thoughts or inner feelings, just the general changes in your brain activity!
                So we might know you're imaginging a movement of some kind, but couldn't tell if you were picturing throwing a baseball or petting a dog. (Or if you even have a dog).

            <div class="lower-text">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
        </div>

        <div class ="text">
            <h4>Aren't BCI systems science fiction or something you have to implant?</h4>
            <p>
                Nope! BCI research has been going for over two decades with pretty significant strides happening in the last 5 years.
                While lots of BCI systems featured in the news are implantable, there are many systems (like those we often work with) which are called "non-implanted" and just use a wearable headset.
                And don't worry - while interest is growing in the space, BCIs have actually been around since the 90s. 
                Recent groups and media are just helping raise the general awareness that these technologies exist - and hopefully events like the <a href="/jams"><span style="color: #fcee21">BCI Game Jam series</span></a> show what this technology could help do!
            </p>

            <h4>Are BCIs safe to use?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes! We primarily work with non-implanted BCI systems, which simply read electric activity from sensors placed on the scalp. 
                These sensors can be dry, use saline (salt water), or a gel to help improve their ability to read the brain's electric signals.
                There are lots of different styles and designs for these types of systems, but they are all designed to be safe and comfortable to wear. (Well most of them...)
                While there are some implanted BCI systems we work with and support, this is done in partnership with teams of medical and engineering experts. (Cause everyone deserves to get a chance to play!)
            </p>
            
            <h4>Can I play any game with a BCI?</h4>
            <p>
                Maybe someday. Right now though, the way games are designed causes some inherent limitations to how well BCIs can be used as a drop-in replacement for traditional control schemes. 
                While some games might work, the experience may not be as fluid, fun, or engaging as it could be.
                But that's what we are here for! We want to help you design and develop games that are for everyone, with a focus on building engaging experiences from the ground up to be playable with BCIs.
                Also creating brand new gaming experiences that are unique to BCI-play is pretty dang fun too.
            </p>

            <h4>Where can I learn more about BCIs and integrating them into gaming?</h4>
            <p>
                There are lots of great resources out there to get you started with BCIs.
                We are still working on making a curated list of these for you to check out.
                Until then, we offer a number of free, open source tools in partnership with BCI4Kids to help you "add in" BCI functionality as seamlessly as possible through our "BCI Essentials" library.  <br>
                Check out the <a href="https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-unity"><span style="color: #fcee21">tools for developing in Unity on Github</span></a> and the complementary <a href="https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-python"><span style="color: #fcee21">suite of backend BCI processing tools in python</span></a> if you're interested.
                Be sure to drop us a line too if you have any questions or want to learn more about how to get started with BCIs in your games!
